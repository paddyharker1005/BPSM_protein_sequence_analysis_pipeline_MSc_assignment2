# protein_sequence_analysis_pipeline_MSc_assignment2
A python3 pipeline created for an MSc assignment that, based on a user-defined protein family and taxonomic group, retrieves relevant full protein sequences from the NCBI protein database and performs multiple protein-specific analyses.

## Overview:

### 1. What is proseq?
*proseq* is a protein sequence analysis tool that, based on a user-defined protein family and
taxonomic group, retrieves relevant full protein sequences from the NCBI protein database
and performs multiple protein-specific analyses - a PROSITE protein motif search, isoelectric
point calculation, and a multiple sequence alignment with conservation plotting, hydropathy
plotting and optional transmembrane segment mapping of aligned sequences. This is a
useful preliminary tool for exploring the key properties of proteins of interest based on their
primary structure.

### 2. Installation
To install *proseq*, do the following in a shell on your system:

```
git clone https://github.com/paddyharker1005/protein_sequence_analysis_pipeline_MSc_assignment2
```

This is made up of 3 files:

```
proseq.py
proseqfunctions.py
README.md
```
